# Further development ideas


* Adding possibility for account having multiple grocerylists. Currently the app supports only one grocerylist per accoount. Multiple grocerylists could be useful if you could share grocerylist with other users.

* Adding database table for Market. This could be used as attribute for item.

* Adding database table for item description. This could for example be vegetable, drink,etc.

* These extra attributes could be used as groups for some interesting summarizations in the archieve page.
